# Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib
This project demonstrates how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python. It includes structured steps from data loading to statistical analysis and visual presentation, using a sample CSV dataset.

## Features
- Data loading and cleaning with pandas

- Summary statistics and group-based analysis

- Visualizations:

  - Line chart (trends over time)

  - Bar chart (category comparison)

  - Histogram (distribution)

  - Scatter plot (relationship between variables)

- Error handling for data import and missing values
